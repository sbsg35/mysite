AWS Lambda does not "infinitely scale". To avoid throttling or other unexpected behaviours, you understand these concepts:

- Concurrency
- Provisioned concurrency
- Reserved concurrency
- Burst concurrency

## Concurrency
> Concurrency is the number of in-flight requests that your Lambda function is handling at the same time. Every account has a total concurrency limit of 1,000 concurrent executions across all functions in an AWS Region (contact AWS support to modify this).

Lambda creates more execution environments according to the number of concurrent requests.

If a Lambda function takes 1 second to process request, and there are 100 requests per second, the concurrency is 100.
**Throttling occurs** after the default concurrency limit of 1000 is reached.

## Provisioned concurrency
Sets the minimum number of execution environments (EE). Prewarms your functions and good for anticipated traffic spikes. It will also minimise cold starts.
AWS Lambda charges for execution time (and number of requests), so provisioned concurrency will incur extra costs.

## Reserved concurrency
Sets a maximum concurrency for a function. No additional costs for setting reserved concurrency.

Use this when:
- ensure critical functions have enough share of account level concurrency
- you need to put a upper cap on a function

> Important: once you have reserved x concurrency on a lambda function, other functions can use that concurrency.


## Burst concurrency
The concurrency scaling rate is 1,000 EE instances every 10 seconds.
For extremely high volume spiky traffic, this can cause issues. 
In my current job, a microservice using Lambda had very spiky high volume traffic. It would often run into throttling errors, because it could not scale fast enough.
I rebuilt this microservice, but that will be a seperate post.
