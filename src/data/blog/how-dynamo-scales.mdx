## How much throughput can I achieve with DynamoDb?

DynamoDB has a limit of 1k RCU per partition and 1k WCU **per partition**, per second.
What does that _actually_ mean for me?

## Dynamo capacity units

Let's understand these concepts first.

### WCU (write capacity units)
One WCU is a write of up to 1KB

- Writing 1 item of 1KB consumes 1WCU
- Writing 2 item of 1.5KB consuimes 2WCU

### RCU (read capacity units)
- Reading 1 item of 4KB consumes 1WCU
- Reading 2 item of 5KB consuimes 2WCU

## Partition
A partition is a portion of your data. A single partition can upto 10gb of data.

DynamoDB partitions transparently, based on your partition key (and other factors). Key ranges are stored together
in the same partition, for quick access.

In the following example, suburb is the partition key, and street is the sort key. Melbourne data will likely be stored together, especially if this
table expects high read/writes.

|suburb|street|
|------|-------|
| Melbourne | Swanston |
| Melbourne| Flinders |
| Hawthorn | Auburn | 

## So how much throughput can I achieve?

DynamoDB's upper limit is 1k RCU per partition and 1k WCU per partition, per second.
The key words here are **per partition**. 

DynamoDB scales by splitting data into different partitions. 
If it detects the table or partition is having increased demand, it will intelligently "partition" (or split) the data. More partitions means more throughput.

> DynamoDB does not merge partitions, it only splits them.

This [article has more detail](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/part-3-scaling-dynamoDB-how-partitions-hot-keys-and-split-for-heat-impact-performance/), but you can effectively achieve millions of reads/writes per second.

## Choosing the right mode (provisioned vs on demand)

### On demand
Let AWS handle scaling for you

### Provisioned
Choose your desired WCU/RCU

### What to choose?

Use On Demand, except if:
- anticipating spiky loads
- migrating large amounts of data to DynamoDb and expecting high traffic initially

In the second point, you can start with Provisioned, and then later switch to On Demand.

The partitioning doesn't happen straight away in On Demand, so there could be a period of low throughput, resulting in throttling errors.
