## Introduction

If you want to fork Uniswap V2 and with custom frontend, read on.

I will be doing a seperate post which goes deep into the code and Uniswap concepts.
This article is a high level approach and assumes you know the basics of Uniswap.

I was tasked to build the [SOMA.finance](https://www.soma.finance/) Decentralised Exchange (DEX) and Liquidity platform.
The contracts were based on Uniswap V2 contracts with security/whitelist additions.

## Initial approach

I forked the [Uniswap V2 interface](https://github.com/Uniswap/interface/releases/tag/v2.6.5)
repository and hooked up our contracts. It was an easy process.

Then I started running into problems:

- It had a lot of features we didn't need (token lists, creating liquidity pools, etc)
- The code was outdated, making it difficult to build upon
- The stakeholders wanted it to be built with our curent design system
- It didn't fit with our existing tech stack
- It was very slow

Given the above, I explored building the frontend from scratch and it was easier than expected.

**TLDR**

- If you want to build something more scalable, utilising the [V2 SDK](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-sdk)
  with your custom front end is the best approach.

## Has this been done before?

If you want to build something quickly, this [article by Ben Haslam](https://medium.com/clearmatics/how-i-made-a-uniswap-interface-from-scratch-b51e1027ca87)
is a great starting point.
However, I didn't want to use direct web3 calls to fetch things like swap prices with the `getAmountsOut` method.
It would mean debounced web3 calls to fetch latest price data as users type their trade amounts. This is not a great UX.
So we ruled Ben's approach out.

## Uniswap V2 SDK

I recommend using the [V2 SDK](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-sdk) if you want to build a custom frontend.
The [V2 SDK](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-sdk) contains helper functions
which calculates price information of pairs involved in a trade without any web3 calls.
We just need provide the latest pair data to these functions for accurate prices. The SDK has [utilities](https://docs.uniswap.org/sdk/v2/reference/fractions) that make it easy to work with BigNumbers.
You don't need to do any Uniswap Math!

Download the source and update the `FACTORY_ADDRESS` and `INIT_CODE_HASH` in [this file](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-sdk/blob/main/src/constants.ts).

## Swap

You need to use three methods from the Uniswap SDK to execute a swap.

### Prior to executing swap

Use these methods from the SDK to get the data needed **before** executing a swap.
I recommend reading the `useTradeExactIn` and `useTradeExactOut` hooks in the Uniswap interface repository,
to help construct the arguments needed for these methods.

`Trade.bestTradeExactIn`

This will find the best path for a trade. Returns a `Trade` object.
It contains the information you need to display before making a trade.

`Trade.bestTradeExactOut`

Works as above but for exact out trades.

### Executing a swap

#### `Router.swapCallParameters`

Use this to generate the function call parameters to execute the swap. It takes a `Trade` object.
You can use ethers or web3.js to execute the call.
